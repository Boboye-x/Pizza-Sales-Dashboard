# Pizza-Sales-Dashboard
Sales Analysis of Pizza Sales to improve business operations. 

There are four CSV files (order details, orders, pizza type, and pizzas). Our goal was to merge those four files and gain insights into Pizza Sales to improve the marketing campaign, increase sales of particular pizza categories and types, and be better prepared to take on orders.

A data model was created using primary keys to merge all four tables.

ðŸ“ˆ Insights Generated via the Dashboard:

1. Classic pizza is most the selling category whereas chicken is the least-selling category.

2. Customers prefer the large size of pizza the most compared to other sizes.

3. The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the top-selling pizza, and The Brie Carre Pizza is the least-selling.

4. The average selling price of pizza is $15.58. By category, the average price of pizza is $17.709.

5. Customers prefer to eat pizza on Friday, but not on Sunday based on the Quantity sold during weekdays.

6. The peak order time for pizza is between 12:00 p.m. to 13:00 p.m.
